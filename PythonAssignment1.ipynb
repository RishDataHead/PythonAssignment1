    "Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "Readability: Python has a clean and readable syntax, making it easier to write and understand code.\n",
    "Large Standard Library: Python comes with a comprehensive standard library, providing a wide range of modules and functions that can be used for various tasks without the need for external dependencies.\n",
    "Vast Ecosystem: Python has a rich ecosystem of third-party libraries and frameworks that cover a wide range of domains, enabling developers to leverage existing solutions and accelerate development.\n",
    "Easy Integration: Python allows seamless integration with other languages such as C/C++, Java, and .NET, making it suitable for building large-scale applications that require different components.\n",
    "Rapid Development: Python's simplicity and productivity-focused features, such as dynamic typing and automatic memory management, contribute to faster development cycles.\n",
    "Cross-Platform Compatibility: Python is available on multiple platforms, allowing developers to write code once and deploy it on different operating systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance: Python is an interpreted language, which can make it slower compared to compiled languages like C or C++. However, performance-critical sections of code can be optimized using compiled extensions or by utilizing specialized libraries.\n",
    "Global Interpreter Lock (GIL): The GIL in CPython (the reference implementation of Python) can limit the execution of threads in parallel, which can impact the performance of CPU-bound multi-threaded applications. However, Python offers solutions such as multiprocessing and asynchronous programming to overcome this limitation.\n",
    "Mobile Development: While Python can be used for mobile app development, it is not as widely adopted as languages like Java or Swift in the mobile development space.\n",
    "Design Restrictions: Python's emphasis on readability and simplicity can lead to design restrictions and less control over low-level details compared to lower-level languages.\n",
    "Version Compatibility: The transition from Python 2 to Python 3 introduced some backward-incompatible changes, resulting in a split between the two versions. This can lead to compatibility issues when working with legacy code or libraries."
